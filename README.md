This project develops an Internet-of-Things (IoT) device, called Underwater Eye, to operate an underwater camera and observe aquatic animals at an extremely close range. 

Underwater Eye is built with a Raspberry Pi, TT motor, motor driver, camera and waterproof camera case. It runs Python code that drops down a camera slowly to a tank, takes pictures and videos in the tank, pulls up the camera, and uploads the pictures/videos to a cloud database called Kintone. 

This project was submitted to and presented at [AnimalHack 2024](https://animalhack.org/ah24/).
