This project delivers a hack to make skateboarding more fun and safer. It turns a skateboard to be an Internet-of-Things (IoT) device with a Raspberry Pi and its peripheral components.

Glow in the Dark Skateboard is a "smart" skateboard that has an electroluminescent (EL) wire and LED lights. The lighting pattern changes based on the skateboard's orientation - level, upward, or downward. This is implemented with Python code that continuously runs on a Raspberry Pi to calculate the pitch of the skateboard with an accelerometer. 

This project was submitted to and presented at [AnimalHack 2024](https://animalhack.org/ah24/).
